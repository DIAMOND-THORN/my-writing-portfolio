PART 1

High noon the night arise                                                 
The angles sings the songs of praise                                 
Thunders roar beneath, beyond.                                    
Acclaim the king, the queen is here.

In air rise the sign of life                                        
Vitality among the sons of men                                                                        
We rise above, beneath, beyond

Our tribe was once crowned in ash                                                          
From ash to crystals you shaped us                                                                               
Now we rule the south, the east, and

Here you are o seminary.

Your greatness shines beyond all time                                                 
A beacon bright, in endless rhyme                                                    
A leader born from skies unkown                                                        
Her wisdom sets the stars alight.

You forged in us the strength to stand                                                              
A legacy etched deep down in the sand                                                                
Through you, we learned the ancient art                                                                                                                       
To walk with valor, heart to heart

But till today they all don’t know                                                                                    
They still ask the nature of our power                                            
But their problem never cease to be the same                                                 
They never acknowledge the knowledge in them.

But don’t go far the them is books                                                                                   
As in them resides the healing power

That all we need is hidden in them.

But the problem is not resolved yet?                                                      
Come and enter in our library                                                                                                                                                                                 
The one and only the all in one

From 1913 until today                                                                                                                   
we built a legacy along the day                                                             
Saint Leon along our way                                                                                   
Our lord’s grace delights our way.

O saint Leon our holy father                                                                    
In every breath, your teachings live                                                                                               
A culture pure in which we give                                                       
No mask no lie no false pretense.

But truth profound, without defense                                                     
Orate in veritate we always roar

Let us praise this seminary our mother                                                                                                
Her name is a fire, an endless flame                                                                                                                    
With every prayer, with every plea,                                             
We find the truth eternally.

For centuries hence, her spirit leads                                                                           
In every word, in every deed                                                                                                                 
A hero’s path, in endless grace                                                           
Forever guiding , forevermore.

With pride we stand, our heritage aglow,                                                   
In valor’s embrace, our spirits flow                                                     
Not in boast, but in strength we soar                                                                   
Through the prayer we attain our goals.

Honored we rise, to bear your name,                                                 
With hearts unshaken, we kindle the flame                                                                                                 
Strong you are, unwavering true                                                                       
The honor you hold is always true.

We raise the fearless, the bold, the true                                                                              
Cornerstones of Rwanda, ever new.                                                                          
With wisdom’s brilliance, our way is lit,                                                                                                                                              
Guiding us forward, where destinies fit.

To victory we march, through endless strife                                                        
In unity’s power, we claim our life.                                                                
Through day and night, with courage untold,                                                                         
We rise as one, as a family and our story unfolds.

Praise for petit Seminaire saint Leon kabgayi.
